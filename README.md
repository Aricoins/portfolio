I am Ariel Rogel, developer and data manager from Bariloche, Argentina.
<br>
I enjoy giving quick answers to problems that seem difficult to solve. I am dedicated to web development of projects that allow me to apply the latest technologies that I master. <br> <br>

I highlight the use of React, Redux, Styled-Component and Bootstrap for the Front-End, and ExpressJS, PostgreSQL and Sequelize for server and database management. I also have experience in NextJS with Typescript and TailwindCSS. <br> <br>
